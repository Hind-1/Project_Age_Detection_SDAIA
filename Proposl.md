## Overview
Recently, many applications using biometrics to extract information from face images such as age, gender, and emotional state. So, in this project we're going to use facial features analysis to estimate the age. The main objective of this project is to use deep-learning algorithms in order to estimate the age from facial image.

## Data Description
In this project we choose the Indian Movie Face database from Kaggle.
This dataset contains 19906 images. The attributes of data are ID â€“ Unique ID of image and Class Age bin of person in image.
## Tools

The tools we will use in our project: python and Jupyter Notebook.     

The python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensorflow
